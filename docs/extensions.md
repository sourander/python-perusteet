# Extensions How-To

Below, you can see a demonstration of all extensions that have been activated in the default `mkdocs.yml` file.

## Syntax highlighting

The code block also demonstrates the copy code, annotation, mark text and keyboard keys functionalities

```python
import os

a = os.name + '-' + 'cat' # (1)
print(a)
```

1.  :cat: I'm a code annotation! I can contain `code`, __formatted
    text__, images, ... basically anything that can be written in Markdown.

Clicking the ==Copy to clipboard== saves you from a tedious ++ctrl+c++ process.

:book: The syntax highlighting supports all languages supported py Pygments. The full list is available [in Pygments docs](https://pygments.org/languages/)

# Images

Use relative path to images. Prefer SVG when possible. The image below is 800x600 SVG and has a solid color rectangle as a background to make sure any text is visible in day/night mode. The color of the background is `HSL(0,0,90)` in Affinity Designer which results to `rgb(231,231,231)`.Created by having "Force Pixel Alignment" activated in Affinity Designer and exported using preset: `SVG (for export)`.

**Figure 1**: *Beautiful corner blobs with lots of negative space. Meaningful text in the middle. Absolutely splendid artwork.*

Cras eu imperdiet urna. Praesent pulvinar metus ac justo faucibus, vel elementum ligula hendrerit. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent ut ex libero.
